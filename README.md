### Objective 
In the age of autonomous vehicles and snap chat filters, image recognition has played a large role in our society and will continue to do so. Computers are beginning to accomplish what humans can do easily, tell apart a lion and a jaguar, read a sign, or recognize a human form. To do so computers have utilized convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are essentially layers of classifiers, as the primary solution to the image classification problem. CNNâ€™s are highly accurate and produce solid results. However, when faced with uncommon objects or unique objects it can fail.

I used a neural network or convolutional neural network to identify Belgian Street Signs. The goal is to increase accuracy without gathering new data. A strong classifier for Street Signs can augment the performance of an Autonomous vehicle. 

### Data Sources
I am currently scrapping images from Google images. I would also like to use labeled data from ApolloScape. I may also borrow from the Belgium Traffic dataset which is a popular, self-driving data set. I would like to store these on AWS, or I can use a hard drive.

### Potential Problems
I think there will be some initial difficulty with cleaning the data. I cannot use all of it so discerning what to use may be a challenge. Also, I think correctly labeling new images, such as pedestrians, and unusual cars will be highly inaccurate. I may need to find more data to mitigate this issue. 

### Whats Next?
I am downloading images from Google image search. My next step would be to use PyTorch or another Neural Network package on the data to get a minimum viable product.

# Classifying Belgian Street Signs To Assist Autonomous Vehicles

A video presentation is avaliable [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQL7tAFc2aE).

### Objective 
In the age of autonomous vehicles and snap chat filters, image recognition has played a large role in our society and will continue to do so. Computers are beginning to accomplish what humans can do easily, tell apart a lion and a jaguar, read a sign, or recognize a human form. To do so computers have utilized convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are essentially layers of classifiers, as the primary solution to the image classification problem. CNNâ€™s are highly accurate and produce solid results. However, when faced with uncommon objects or unique objects it can fail.

I used a neural network or convolutional neural network to identify Belgian Street Signs. The goal is to increase accuracy without gathering new data. A strong classifier for Street Signs can augment the performance of an Autonomous vehicle. 

### Data Source
The data I used is available at the link below. I downloaded the images used for Classification which were already split into testing and training sets. This is a popular data set to use for autonomous vehicles because it contains pictures with poor lighting and sub-optimal angles.

### Jupyter Notebooks
My workflow is detailed in the Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook contains a separate portion of the process. If running the notebooks, I suggest running them in numerical order and using a powerful GPU for the notebooks that contain AWS (Amazon Web Services) in them. I used a machine learning AWS server with GPU computing that cost about 3$/hour.

### Future Improvements?
I would like to improve the performance by adding layers to my CNN, or distorting the images to give my network more training data.
